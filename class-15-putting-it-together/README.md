# Assignment for Class 15 - Project Week Kickoff!
There is no immediate submission for this process. It's part of the final project, and we'll review as a group during our first evening of projects!

## Problem Domain
In 2014, nearly two million Americans aged 12 or older either abused or were dependent on opioid painkillers, and 61% of drug overdose deaths involved either an opioid painkiller or heroin.  Naloxone is an antidote for an opioid overdose, whether from prescription opioids or heroin.  It is a prescription drug with few side effects that rapidly reverses the effects of opioid overdoses.  Although most frequently used in emergency rooms and on ambulances, many states have recently taken steps to make it easier for people in the general public, including family and friends of drug users, to carry and administer naloxone.

Despite the increasing availability of naloxone, people carrying naloxone are often unaware when an overdose occurs nearby.  Currently, there are no mechanisms to alert carriers of naloxone to a person in need of the medication.  This is where you come in!

Using the skills you've learned to this point, define and scope your implementation for review with the class and instructional team. Consider your MVP, and timeline for implementation. You can then begin to scope stretch goals that the team can continue to iterate through for the remainder of the project implementation period.

#### Things to consider:
* This project will not inherently have a back-end (Your instructional team may help with this as a stretch goal)
* You should plan to have some storage capability for your project's data models
* This site should have a mobile-first design and implementation
* This project should be deployed via Heroku
  * If you choose, there are storage options as add-ons for Heroku
* You may consider your users for this app, and whether it makes sense to have two or more different entry points to the app
* Scope your idea as if we can do anything we want, and then work backwards into a manageable MVP scope with attainable stretch goals. 


## User Stories (Begin writing some user stories for your project)
*As a <Person>, I want <Some thing>, so that <Some effect>.*
